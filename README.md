  <h1>Open SWE - An Open-Source Asynchronous Coding Agent</h1>
</div>

Open SWE is an open-source cloud-based asynchronous coding agent built with [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/). It autonomously understands codebases, plans solutions, and executes code changes across entire repositories—from initial planning to opening pull requests.

> [!TIP]
> Try out Open SWE yourself using our [public demo](https://swe.langchain.com)!
>
> **Note: you're required to set your own LLM API keys to use the demo.**

# Features

![UI Screenshot](./static/ui-screenshot.png)

- 📝 **Planning**: Open SWE has a dedicated planning step which allows it to deeply understand complex codebases and nuanced tasks. You're also given the ability to accept, edit, or reject the proposed plan before it's executed.
- 🤝 **Human in the loop**: With Open SWE, you can send it messages while it's running (both during the planning and execution steps). This allows for giving real time feedback and instructions without having to interrupt the process.
- 🏃 **Parallel Execution**: You can run as many Open SWE tasks as you want in parallel! Since it runs in a sandbox environment in the cloud, you're not limited by the number of tasks you can run at once.
- 🧑‍💻 **End to end task management**: Open SWE will automatically create GitHub issues for tasks, and create pull requests which will close the issue when implementation is complete.


## Usage

Open SWE can be used in multiple ways:

- 🖥️ **From the UI**. You can create, manage and execute Open SWE tasks from the [web application](https://swe.langchain.com). See the ['From the UI' page](https://docs.langchain.com/labs/swe/usage/ui) in the docs for more information.
- 📝 **From GitHub**. You can start Open SWE tasks directly from GitHub issues simply by adding a label `open-swe`, or `open-swe-auto` (adding `-auto` will cause Open SWE to automatically accept the plan, requiring no intervention from you). For enhanced performance on complex tasks, use `open-swe-max` or `open-swe-max-auto` labels which utilize Claude Opus 4.1 for both planning and programming. See the ['From GitHub' page](https://docs.langchain.com/labs/swe/usage/github) in the docs for more information.

## Docker

You can build and run Open SWE in a Docker container:

1. **Build the image**
   ```bash
   docker build -t open-swe .
   ```
2. **Run the container**
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name open-swe \
     -p 2024:2024 \
     -v /path/to/your/project:/workspace/project \
     open-swe
   ```
3. **Start the CLI**
   ```bash
   docker exec -it \
     -e OPEN_SWE_LOCAL_PROJECT_PATH=/workspace/project \
     open-swe \
     yarn workspace @open-swe/cli cli
   ```

This launches the LangGraph server inside the container and attaches the CLI to the mounted repository.
